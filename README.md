# Job Board App

A React.js and Next.js application styled with Tailwind CSS that helps users find job listings based on their desired work location and skill set. Users input their location and skills, use a slider to indicate their years of experience, and view matching job listings with job details and applicant count. The "Apply Now" button opens a modal for entering information, with a disabled submit button for future enhancements.
